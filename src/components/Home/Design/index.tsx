                    <p>I've built my career around the idea that software should be beautiful, as well as functional, because it's not just about how things lookâ€”it's also about how they feel.</p>
                    <p>I believe that design is more than just an aesthetic choice: it's an important part of how we interact with our world, and how we connect with each other. As such, I work hard to ensure that every project I take on is designed in such a way that makes users feel connected with the product and its creators.</p>
